# This is a Klipper plugin for a self calibrating Z offset

This is a plugin to self calibrate the nozzle offset to the print surface on a 3D printer
using Klipper. There is no need for a manual Z offset or first layer calibration any more.
It is possible to change any variable in the printer from the temperature, the nozzle,
the flex plate, any modding on the print head or bed or even changing the Z endstop
position value in the klipper configuration. Any of these changes or even all of them
together do **not** affect the first layer at all.

Here is a small video for a demonstration:

## Why This

- With the Voron V1/V2 Z endstop (the one where the tip of the nozzle clicks on a switch),
  you can exchange nozzles without adapting the offset:
  ![endstop offset](pictures/endstop-offset.png)
- Or, by using a mag-probe (or SuperPinda, but this is not probing the surface directly
  and thus needs an other offset which is not as constant as the one of a switch)
  configured as Z endstop, you can exchange the flex plates without adapting the offset:
  ![probe offset](pictures/probe-offset.png)
- But, why can't you get both of it? Or even more.. ?

And this is what I did. I just combined these two probing methods to be completely
independent of any offset calibrations - forever. This is so amazing! :tada:

## Requirements

- A Z endstop where the tip of the nozzle drives on a switch (like the standard
  Voron V1/V2 enstop). **It will not work with the virtual pin of the probe as endstop!**
  It is not essential to have a Voron printer for this - but this kind of endstop.
- A magnetic switch based probe at the print head - instead of the stock inductive probe
  (e.g. [this ones from Annex](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe),
  or the popular drop in replacement [KlickyProbe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe)
  with many mounting options)
- Both, the Z endstop and mag-probe are configured properly and homing and QGL are working.
- The "z_calibration.py" file needs to be copied to the `klipper/klippy/extras` folder.
  Klipper will then load this file if it finds the "[z_calibration]" configuration section.
  It does not interfere with the Moonraker's Klipper update since git ignores unknown
  files.
- It's good practise to use the probe switch as normally closed. Then, macros can detect
  if the probe is attached/released properly. The plugin is also able to detect that
  the mag-probe is attached to the print head - otherwise it will stop!
- (My previous Klipper macro for compensating the temperature based expansion of the
  Z endstop rod is **not** needed anymore.)

>:point_up: **Note:** After copying the pyhton script, a full Klipper service restart is needed to
> load it!

## What It Does

1. A normal homing of all axes using the Z endstop for Z (this is not part of this plugin).
   Now we have a zero point in Z. Everything is in relation to this point now. So, a new
   homing would change everything, since the homing is not that precise. That is one point,
   why absolute values of the offset are not so relevant.
2. Determine the height of the nozzle by probing the tip of it on the Z endstop
   (this can be slightly different to the homed one):
   ![nozzle position](pictures/nozzle-position.png)
3. Determine the height of the mag-probe by probing the body of the switch on the
   z-endstop:
   ![switch position](pictures/switch-position.png)
4. Calculate the offset between the tip of the nozzle and the trigger point of the
   mag-probe:

   `nozzle switch offset = mag probe height - nozzle height + switch offset`

   ![switch offset](pictures/switch-offset.png)
5. Determine the height of the print surface by probing one point with the mag-probe.
6. Now, calculate the final offset:

   `probe offset = probed height - calculated nozzle switch offset`

7. Finally, the calculated offset is applied by using the `SET_GCODE_OFFSET` command
   (a previous offset is resetted before!).

### Drawback

The only downside is, that the trigger point of the mag-probe cannot be probed directly.
This is why the body of the switch is clicked on the endstop. This small offset between the
body of the switch and the trigger point can be taken from the datasheet of the switch and
is hardly ever influenced in any way. And, this is the perfect setting for fine tuning
the first layer.

### Interference

Temperature or humindity changes are not a big deal since the switch is not affected much
by them and all values are probed in a small time period and only the releations to each
other are used. The nozzle height in step 2 can be determined some time later and even
many celsius higher in the printer, compared to the homing in step 1. That is why the
nozzle is probed again and can vary a little to the first homing position.

### Example

The output of the calibration with all determined positions looks like this
(the offset is the one which is applied as GCode offset):

```text
Z-CALIBRATION: ENDSTOP=-0.300 NOZZLE=-0.300 SWITCH=6.208 PROBE=7.013 --> OFFSET=-0.170
```

The endstop value is the homed Z position which is always zero or the configure
"stepper_z:position_endstop" setting - and in this case, it's even the same as the
probed nozzle hight.

### Thermal Frame Expansion

There is a further Klipper plugin for adapting the Z height continuously to the thermal
expansion of the printer frame after starting a print. It is from alchemyEngine and
can be found
[here](https://github.com/alchemyEngine/klipper_frame_expansion_comp).

## How To Install It

To install this plugin, you need to copy the `z_calibration.py` file into the `extras`
folder of klipper. Like:

```bash
/home/pi/klipper/klippy/extras/z_calibration.py
```

An alternative would be to clone this repo and run the `install.sh` script. Like:

```bash
cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration.git
./klipper_z_calibration/install.sh
```

More on this in the [Moonraker Updater](#moonraker-updater) section.

## How To Configure It

### Preconditions

As a precondition, the probe needs to be configured properly. It must work flawlessly!
If you don't know how, **please have a look at the
[KlickyProbe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) and how to configure it!**
There is also a very good but complexe example configuration from
[zellneralex](https://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config/tree/master).

Now, if the probe works reliably, Then this auto Z offset calibration is basically configured
by adding the `z_calibration` section. All possible properties and it's defalt values
are documented here under [configurations](#configurations).

A minimal start configuration could look like this:

```text
[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position:   <X,Y position for clicking the nozzle on the Z endstop>
switch_xy_position:   <X,Y position for clicking the probe's switch body on the Z endstop>
bed_xy_position:      <X,Y position for probing the bed, for instance the center point>
switch_offset:        <offset of the switch trigger (read the Switch Offset section!)>
start_gcode:          <macro name for attaching the probe>
#before_switch_gcode: <macro name for attaching the probe AFTER probing the nozzle>
end_gcode:            <macro name for docking the probe>
```

It is good practice to use more than one sample and use "median" as "probe:samples_result".
And it's **important** to configure an appropriate probe offset in X, Y and **Z**. The
Z offset does not need to be an exact value, since we do not use it as an offset, but it
needs to be roughly a real value!

It even doesn't matter what "stepper_z:position_endstop" value is configured in Klipper.
All positions are relative to this point - only the absolute values are different. But,
it's advisable to configure a safe value here to not crash the nozzle into the build
plate by accident. The plugin only changes the GCode offset and it's still possible to
move the nozzle beyond this offset.

### Configurations

The following configuration is needed to activate the plugin and to set some needed values:

>:bulb: **NEW:** If the nozzle cannot be probed with the mag-probe attached (e.g.: Voron V1), then
> it's now possible to detach (start_gcode), attach before probing the switch (before_switch_gcode)
> and even detaching it at the end (end_gcode).

```

>:bulb: **INFO:** The settings about probing from this section do not apply to the probing on the
>bed, since the script just calls the probe to do it's job at this point. Only the first fast down
>probing is covered by this script directly.

### Bed Mesh

If you use a bed mesh, the coordinates for probing on the print bed must be exactly the
relative reference point of the mesh since this is the zero point! But, you can ommit
these properties completely now and the relative reference point of the mesh will be
taken automatically (for this, the "bed_mesh:relative_reference_index" setting is required
and there is no support for round bed/mesh so far)!

### Switch Offset

The "z_calibration:switch_offset" is the already mentioned offset from the switch body
(which is the probed position) to the actual trigger point above it. A starting point
for this value can be taken from the datasheet of the Omron switch (D2F-5: 0.5mm and SSG-5H: 0.7mm).
It's safe to start with a little less depending on the squishiness you prefer for the
first layer (for me, it's about 0.46 for the D2F-5). So, with a smaller offset value, the nozzle
is more away from the bed! The value cannot be negative.

For example, the datasheet of the D2F-5:

![endstop offset](pictures/d2f-example.png)

And the calculation of the offset base:

```text
offset base = OP (Operation Position) - switch body height
     0.5 mm = 5.5 mm - 5 mm
```

#### How About A Negative Switch Offset?

First of all, there cannot be a negative switch_offset! If the switch_offset is already
really small after tuning it and the nozzle is still too close to the bed, then there is
something wrong measuring the probe's body. The following image illustrates this context:

![switch offset](pictures/negative-switch-offset.png)

So, please check your endstop, the rod of the endstop and the position touching the body
of the probe's switch!

> **:exclamation: Please, do NOT drive the endstop pin on the switch's actuator directly!
> Otherwise, you do it on your own risk and I will reject any request for support!**

If you do so, a correct or at least a working measured hight at the switch is all up to the
different forces in this system. But forces can change due to many reasons. The best case
would be that the actuator is pushed all the way in until the pin touches the body of the
switch - before the endstop is triggered! But it can also be anything in between...
So, there is no reason to not touch the body directly in a safe and robust way :thumbsup:

### Moonraker Updater

>:point_up: **Attention:** If this was already configure prior to version 0.8,
> a manual execution of the "install.sh" script is needed to update the soft link and
> the dummy service definition like: `/home/pi/klipper_z_calibration/install.sh`!

Now, a update with the Moonraker update manager is possible by adding this configuration
block to the "moonraker.conf":

```text
[update_manager client z_calibration]
type: git_repo
path: /home/pi/klipper_z_calibration
origin: https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration.git
install_script: install.sh
```

For this, you need to clone this repository in your home directory (/home/pi):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration.git
```

The script assumes that Klipper is also in your home directory under
"klipper": `${HOME}/klipper`.

>:point_up: **NOTE:** Currently, there is a dummy systemd service installed
> to satisfy moonraker's update manager which also restarts Klipper after an
> update.

## How To Test It

Do not bother too much about absolute values of the calculated offsets. These can vary a lot.
Only the real position from the nozzle to the bed counts. To test this, the result of the
calibration can be queried by `GET_POSITION` first:

```text
> CALIBRATE_Z
> Z-CALIBRATION: ENDSTOP=-0.300 NOZZLE=-0.267 SWITCH=2.370 PROBE=3.093 --> OFFSET=-0.010000
> GET_POSITION
> mcu: stepper_x:17085 stepper_y:15625 stepper_z:-51454 stepper_z1:-51454 stepper_z2:-51454 stepper_z3:-51454
> stepper: stepper_x:552.500000 stepper_y:-47.500000 stepper_z:10.022500 stepper_z1:10.022500 stepper_z2:10.022500 stepper_z3:10.022500
> kinematic: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:10.022500
> toolhead: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:10.021472 E:0.000000
> gcode: X:252.500000 Y:300.000000 Z:9.990000 E:0.000000
> gcode base: X:0.000000 Y:0.000000 Z:-0.010000 E:0.000000
> gcode homing: X:0.000000 Y:0.000000 Z:-0.010000
```

Here, the Z position in "gcode base" reflects the calibrated Z offset.

Then, the offset can be tested by moving the nozzle slowly down to zero by moving it in
multiple steps. It's good to do this by using GCodes, since the offset is applied as
GCode-Offset. For example like this:

```gcode
> G90
> G0 Z5
> G0 Z3
> G0 Z1
> G0 Z0.5
> G0 Z0.3
> G0 Z0.1
```

Check the distance to the print surface after every step. If there is a small discrepancy
(which should be smaller than the offset base from the switch's datasheet), then adapt
the "z_calibration:switch_offset" by that value. Decreasing the "switch_offset" will move
the nozzle more away from the bed.

And finally, if you have double checked, that the calibrated offset is correct, you can go
for fine tuning the "z_calibration:switch_offset" by actually printing first layer tests.

## How To Use It

>:pencil2: **NOTE:** If you calibrate Z within a `SAVE_GCODE_STATE` and `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE`,
> the calibrated offset will be lost after calling `RESTORE_GCODE_STATE`!

### Command CALIBRATE_Z

The calibration is started by using the `CALIBRATE_Z` command. There are no more parameters.
If the probe is not attached to the print head, it will abort the calibration process
(if configured normaly closed). So, macros can help here to attach and detach the probe like
this:

```gcode
[gcode_macro CALIBRATE_Z]
rename_existing: BASE_CALIBRATE_Z
gcode:
    CG28
    M117 Z-Calibration..
    _SET_LOWER_STEPPER_CURRENT  # I lower the stepper current for homing and probing 
    ATTACH_PROBE                # a macro for fetching the probe first
    BASE_CALIBRATE_Z
    DETACH_PROBE                # and parking it afterwards
    _RESET_STEPPER_CURRENT      # resetting the stepper current
    M117
```

Then the `CALIBRATE_Z` command needs to be added to the `PRINT_START` macro. For this,
just replace the second Z homing after QGL and nozzle cleaning with the calibration. A
second homing is not needed anymore.

**:exclamation: And remove any Z offset adjustments here (like `SET_GCODE_OFFSET`) :exclamation:**

The print start sequence could look like this:

1. Home all axes
2. Heat up the bed and nozzle (and chamber)
3. Get probe, make QGL, park probe
4. Purge and clean the nozzle
5. Get probe, CALIBRATE_Z, park probe
6. (Adjust Z offset if needed somehow)
7. Print intro line
8. Start printing...

I don't get any reasons, but if you still need to adjust the offset from your Slicers
start GCode, then add this to your `PRINT_START` macro **after** the Z calibration:

```text
# Adjust the G-Code Z offset if needed
SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z_ADJUST={params.Z_ADJUST|default(0.0)|float} MOVE=1
```

Then, you can use `Z_ADJUST=0.0` in your Slicer. This does **not** reset to a fixed
offset but adjusts it by the given value!

>:pencil2: **NOTE:** Do not home Z again after running this calibration or it needs to be executed again!

Now, I wish you happy printing with an always perfect first layer - doesn't matter what you just
modded on your printer's head or bed or what nozzle and flex plate you like to use for your next
project. It's just perfect :smiley:

### Command PROBE_Z_ACCURACY

There is also a PROBE_Z_ACCURACY command to test the accuracy of the Z endstop:

```text
PROBE_Z_ACCURACY [PROBE_SPEED=<mm/s>] [LIFT_SPEED=<mm/s>] [SAMPLES=<count>] [SAMPLE_RETRACT_DIST=<mm>]
```

It calculates the maximum, minimum, average, median and standard deviation of multiple probe samles on
the endstop by taking the configured nozzle position on the endstop. The optional parameters default
to their equivalent setting in the z_calibration config section.

## Disclaimer

:construction::construction_worker: It works flawlessly for me. But, at this moment it is not widely tested. And I don't know
much about the Klipper internals. So, I had to figure it out by myself and found this as a
working way for me. If there are better/easier ways to accomplish it, please don't
hesitate to contact me!
